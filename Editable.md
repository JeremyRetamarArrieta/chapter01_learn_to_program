# chapter01_learn_to_program


Ch 1. Motivation

Why do you want to learn to program? Is this a hobby for you or do you want to take it to the next level and seek job opportunities? Now if you enjoy learning about tech and love experimenting, programming software is definitely going to be a great way to express those aspirations. If you are a beginner just wanting to know the basics so you can start to feel your way around the field, this is probably going to help. I am also going to list a bunch of free classes that helped me along the way. I have been studying programming online via free classes for five years now. I continue to teach myself and will hopefully teach others in the process. With that in mind, learning to program is a lot like learning to play Dark Souls. You are going to mess up a lot and sometimes you’ll need to start from zero. (image of programming branches take) The longer you strive to learn software the more rewarding the experience will be. I have added years of practice to my belt and still have oceans of information to sift through.

Once you’ve found your motivations for doing this it is important to set a small, achievable goal; maybe something you can achieve every week. Start building small habits that will lead to future success. Like finish one video a day or add another line of code to your project. Anything you can think of and write down. Another thing that can help is telling people about what your goals are. This is a social way of keeping your self accountable. The positive steps you can take towards achieving your goals get easier and easier when broken down into smaller chunks. Now company executives cut their days into very small time chunks. Some, like Elon Musk, use 5 minute increments of time. That is a lot and probably overkill for a regular person. If you want to manage an empire you will need every second possible. If you want to manage a bookstore you probably have lot more leeway. I myself suffer from TTM or terrible time management. The tools I mentioned previously can help you in just about any task you want to achieve.

You broke down your dream into achievable small goals. Next you’ll want to think about how many of those goals you can achieve in two weeks. This will help you with scope and focus. You know you could have a very productive week or the complete opposite. Setting up goals in two week sprints lets you reflect on how you are making progress towards those goals and what possible improvements you could make on your methods in the next weeks. A lot of companies use Agile or Scrum. I am recommending something similar but for studying. You can watch a ton of tutorials but if you never actually code you are shooting yourself in the foot. So I would say take like an hour of lecture or as much as you can handle. Then see if you can use it to perform a task. This will reinforce in your head that you are fully capable of doing this kind of work. In fact I think anyone stubborn enough can learn programming. I am very stubborn. Four years of researching different places of studying and possible scholarships has given me some experience of learning to learn.

Teaching yourself to learn is probably one of the prerequisites if you are going to take the self-taught path. I didn’t have an option. I couldn’t afford to quit my job and go to school. So I searched online for any available resources. My main learning center became YouTube. I would love to watch Siraj Raval talk about machine learning. Next, I found MIT opencourseware. It was old MIT classes that they had recorded and you could watch the lectures for free. Yes, it was quite boring but it gave me the knowledge of computer science I had a hard time finding elsewhere. These days I recommend EDX.org they offer course auditing for free and you can pay for credit too. I frequented Khan Academy, Udacity, and Udemy, but it was hard to learn self-paced since there is not a lot of support.

Support can be found in a couple of different ways. The best way by far is to join local meetups groups for programming. That can be in any programming language just being able to talk to someone else interested in programming will help project you forward. I myself am a huge fan of the Javascript community here in Utah. The UtahJS Conference was a spectacle for me to experience. They have a Slack channel and meetups monthly. Silicon Slopes was another conference I checked out in 2018. Those you pay to be in but you can learn so much in those conferences. The free support would be in forums or study groups. You can just Google or DuckDuckGo if you like your privacy for something like “javascript study groups” and then enter your city after groups. Another computer programming language I recommend learning is Python. Most of the community sees Python as a language that is going to continue to grow about 4% each year compared to other languages that are not even one whole percentage!

So lets recap on some of the things I covered. First, learn why you are going to learn programming. Second, if you are going to be on the internet I recommend getting a VPN with military grade encryption. Next, break down what your main goals are into smaller achievable goals. Use the week or two week sprints idea. Self-reflect on how you did after the week or second week. Write down results, and share them with others to hold yourself socially accountable. Scheduling can be difficult but just giving yourself deadlines is a step in the right direction. Afterwards you will want to show off some of your work or project to anyone that will listen or watch to reinforce that you are making progress. Last, I shared some really great resources I found myself through years of research.

Youtube is also a really great resource to give you some tutorials if you are looking for a specific example of a project.

I have found the UtahJS community to be overall very welcoming and helpful. I think that there are probably more communities like this around all the U.S. They hold a conference every year too. Really great resource to find out about new technologies. This is mainly a JavaScript community but there are some experts in Angular and React as well.
